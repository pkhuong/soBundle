Complicated status.  I, Paul-Virak Khuong, have only written

 README
 bundle_solver.{C,h,hpp}
 splp.c
 test.c
 test2.c

and would like to release that under a BSD license (as follows).
However, the library that code depends on is distributed under a more
demanding Academic License (academicl.txt).  It seems that the code I
have written is thus also under that Academic License.

Finally, the status of my distributing code under that Academic
License is foggy.  However, I'm afraid that the code may not work with
other version of the library, and will continue to distribute it until
told otherwise.  Remember to read the Academic License and comply to
its terms as well.
